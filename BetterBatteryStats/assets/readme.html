<h2>BetterBatteryStats<span>Release Notes</span></h2> 
<div id="content">

<h2>What you should know about references</h2>
<p>
BetterBatteryStats does not collect data in the background but uses references saved at specific times (on specific events):
<ul>
	<li><b>Boot</b>: is saved when your phone boots, deletes all other refrences</li>
	<li><b>Unplug</b>: is saved when you unplug your phone from the charger</li>
	<li><b>Charged</b>: is saved when your phone gets charged to 100%</li>
	<li><b>Screen Off</b>: is saved when the screen of your phone goes off</li>
	<li><b>Custom</b>: is saved when you select the option to save a custom reference from the menu</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<b>As long as those events did not occur or after a reboot BBS will notify you about a missing reference. This is not a bug, it's the way BBS was designed</b>
<br/><br/>
<h2>Kitkat users</h2>
Google has made changes to Kitkat that affect the way BBS works and some major changes needed to be made to adapt:
<ul>
<li>If your device is not rooted you will have no access to Partial Wakelocks anymore</li>
<li>If your device is rooted make sure to enable the advanced root features access all features (with some workarounds)</li>
<li>BBS can now be installed as a system app (advanced preferences). This does not affect updatability and provides you the full feature set (no workarounds) on Kitkat</li>
</ul>   	
<h2>v1.16.0.0_B1 2013-11-25</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed app ops call from package view (kitkat)</li>
</ul>
